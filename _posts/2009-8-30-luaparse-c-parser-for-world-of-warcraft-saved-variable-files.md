It is a common task for developers creating add-ons for World of
Warcraft to process lua files on the server side. YouPVP, for example,
receives lua files generated by an add-on and parses battlegrounds data
into the database. Since I was building a website on an asp.net
platform, I needed lua parser in C#. Unfortunately, after spending some
time on the internet, I couldn't find any .net solutions that would
work for me, so I wrote my own. If you need to parse warcraft lua files
in a .net environment, I hope you will find my LuaParse class to be
useful.
