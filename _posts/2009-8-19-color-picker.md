I am a bit of a fan of colors and consequently of color pickers. First
release of Silverlight didnâ€™t provide much help with control development
and my first color picker was very simple: four sliders, one for each
of the color components of RGBA color.

With release of Silverlight 3.0 developers have a choice of the color
pickers made by the enthusiasts and companies specializing in
Silverlight controls.

Unfortunately, the only kind of color pickers I could find are based
on SV+H model. I figure it is due to Microsoft products favoring that
type of color picker. Personally, I prefer HS+V color pickers, commonly
used in Adobe products, so I had to sit down and build one myself.

Color picker was my first custom control and quite expectedly I ran
into some issues during development, but it was a good learning
experience.

Color picker is free to use in any projects. Have fun.
