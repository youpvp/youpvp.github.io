Upon receiving numerous requests (three, to be precise) for source code for my color picker control
(see ["Color picker control for Silverlight"](/blog/color-picker-control-for-silverlight)), I’ve decided it’s time
to try one of the open source repositories, and have created a fresh new project on the CodePlex:
[http://colorpickr.codeplex.com](http://colorpickr.codeplex.com).
Currently it is just source code, but I’m going to create a [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org) package and link it from
the project’s home page.
