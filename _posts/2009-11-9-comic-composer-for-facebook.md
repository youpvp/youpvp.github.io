If you visited my <a href="/page/silverlight-projects">projects</a>
page then you know about silverlight comic builder I am working on.

is the latest development bringing user created comics strips to
Facebook platform. I am currently looking for beta testers to help me
to prepare application for general release. Please, leave your comments
and suggestions in this post.
